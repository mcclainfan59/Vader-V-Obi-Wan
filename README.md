# Vader-V-Obi-Wan
Who is likely to win a rematch between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi


## Summary

This will be a scientific data of who would win a fifth rematch between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Sith Lord Darth Vader. The two fierce warriors have battled four times in the past. Officially, Kenobi won 2 duels and Lord Vader won one with one dual technically ending without a winning result as Obi-Wan Kenobi fled before the duel concluded. It is important to acknowledge that both competitors will be returning from the dead as force ghosts. Thus, traditional Jedi abilities may not be applicable as it will likely come down to who has mastered the form from beyond death. Although it is most likely that both Jedi Masters woth their extreme and vest to knowledge of the force will have self taught how to remortalize as a physical being. Therefore, this model will be written in the expectation that they are both physical beings again and all the natural laws of the Star Wars universe apply. For example, if a limb were to be removed during battle, it would detatch from the body of the Jedi just as it would have during episodes one through nine. Furthermore, it is important to understand that neither Jedis will have any extra abilities that they did not have before their death. The only thing that will separate them in their current state from their former self is the knowledge they have acquired through the forces in life after death.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

Now, through the use of ai, we will finally learn who is indeed the true Jedi master between the former teacher and learner. Surprisingly, this is not an issue that I hear brought up very often. This topic is interesting because it fits two of the greatest Jedi Masters of all time against each other again. It is important because it could be a major determining factor for whether there ever will be returned balance to the force. My personal motivation for this AI structure is human curiosity.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

There are many different circumstances in which the two Jedis could face off again. Where and when are the two most important factors. For the sake of this argument, it will be assumed that the two Jedis will be battling alone. It is important to remember that while they are both old, that Darth Vader still has an age advantage. He is younger than Obi Wan Kenobi by a full generation. While that reality still holds water at the moment. It won't forever. Such a small difference still plays a role if one of the competitors is under the age of 100. However, if 1000 years has passed, then the age gap will not make any difference at all and thus won't have any effect on the algorithms determination. Perhaps the most important is the environment. During their most recent dual, a Darth Vader victory upon the Death Star, Lord Vader had a clear advantage. He was in a natural environment surrounded by many of his soldiers. his natural environment being the death star that he was surely more familiar with than Obi Wan. Yet there are other environments, in which case Obi Wan would have a clear advantage. The two most notably being sand and fire. if either are present in the dueling environment, then Obi Wan's chances of winning would go up dramatically. Oh, be one is also a terrific swimmer. If you remember in the Phantom Menace, Obi Wan and his former master Quigon Jin were able to swim great distances at extreme deaths without being bothered by the dangers and pressure of the ocean.
